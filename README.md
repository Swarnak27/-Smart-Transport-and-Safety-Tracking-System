# ðŸšŒ Smart Transport and Safety Tracking System 

## Overview

This project simulates a **Smart Transport and Safety Tracking System** using **MySQL**. It focuses on monitoring and analyzing transportation data for **students, employees, or public passengers**, ensuring **safe, timely, and efficient** transport operations.

---

## Project Objective

To develop a smart transport tracking system that collects and analyzes key data such as:

- Bus routes, boarding logs, GPS tracking
- Pickup/drop confirmation
- Overcrowding detection
- Missed pickups or safety incidents
- Driver and supervisor assignments

---

## SQL Concepts Covered

This project demonstrates core to advanced SQL, including:

- âœ… `WHERE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE` â€“ filtering
- âœ… `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `OFFSET` â€“ sorting and pagination
- âœ… `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` â€“ aggregate functions
- âœ… `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` â€“ grouped analysis
- âœ… `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN` â€“ relational queries
- âœ… Subqueries â€“ both correlated and non-correlated
- âœ… Set operators â€“ `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`
